# ESP32_led_strip
This library can be used to drive addressable LED strips from the ESP32 using the RMT peripheral. This allows the RMT peripheral to handle all of the transmission while the processor is free to support other tasks.

The libraryis based on [Lucas Bruder's project ](https://github.com/Lucas-Bruder/ESP32_LED_STRIP) and the [Arduino Adafruit_Neopixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) libraries.
